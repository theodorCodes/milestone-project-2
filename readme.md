    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (app.js:120)

Bug issue:
app.js:111: var cardId = this.getAttribute('data-id'); # this was raised as an issue
app.js:120: selectedCard(); # this was the problem as the function was was not finished, but I have already logged the function with console.log

```

Bug 3
Gameplay: If clicking fast enough player can select multiple cards that exceeds 2 cards to compair against each other.
    // ISSUE: in case of 'multiple selections' it stores the data-id of the last entry
    // the allowance of multi selections is an issue
    // storing the last item when someone randomly clicks more then 2 cards is an issue


# Polishing Gameplay

Adding the feature to count moves for each step as 0.5 and used Math.round() to display only round numbers for the player.
