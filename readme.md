*Not the traditional memory game. It helps to find out if we have the capability to memorise images in detail. Instead of flipping cards to find pairs you will be presented with a preview of available cards before you start the traditional memory game. It aims to answer the question if we have an eidetic or photographic memory.*

## Project



#### Project Introduction

As part of a student project of Code Institute, I chose to write a memory game to apply and use vanilla JavaScript with HTML and CSS without any frameworks. In this grid based memory game the user has to flip through a group of cards to find pairs that match with each other. When two cards are identical and match the user gains 1 point.



#### User Story and Goals

As a user I expect a casual game to be **easy to understand** without any instructions. It has to be **entertaining** or offer at least **some challenges to capture my mind**. Once I'm hooked up with the game it has to offer some **levels to keep me playing**. The layout and the design is somewhat important as it puts me into the mindset or **mood that I'm playing a game**.



#### Developer Story and Goals

**Hands-on experience** to apply and built something with JavaScript after going through a long process of learning the ins and outs of this language. A game that looks and works flawlessly. **Implementation of features**, **run test** and gain **valuable experience** and problem-solving **practice**.

*In the beginning of this project I thought about a traditional memory game where you flip the cards one by one, and collect the cards once you have found a matching pair. While doing a little bit of research about why it is challenging to play this game, I found out that we actually do not have an eidetic or photographic memory (please see link in the [memory game](https://theodorcodes.github.io/milestone-project-2/)). Therefor the idea of creating "a game to train your memory" has changed into a game to demonstrate how hard it actually is to recall an image in detail.*



## Features



#### Planned Features

The traditional memory game play is fairly easy and all you have to do is to **flip the cards** and **find matching pairs**. To add some features, this game consist of **4 levels** and you can get to the next level once you have found all pairs from the current level. As the level increases **you are challenged to find more cards**. 
As this excercise is about interactivity the game is designed to guide the user throughout the game. When the website launches, a modal view is presented to invite the user to start the game. 
During the game play the top header provides the user with useful information such as reminding the user to "Choose another card" when the user has clicked the same card twice by accident, or it informes the user about a match in case a pair of cards were found. 
A modal view appears at the end of each level to notify the user about the game stats and leads the user to play the next level. 



#### Features Implemented

Starting from the top of the game layout, the header has a **game assistant**, which adds to the interactivity of the game play and notifies the user of the moves made such as "You found a match" or "Try again" in case the cards do not match. Right under the game assistant is the **game stats** area where the user can see the **current level**, **moves made** and **score** which updates instantly once the user has found a pair of cards. The main area features the **playing cards**, which will be shuffled or **randomised** for each game play and **increases** as the user moves up to the next level. The footer area has a **reset button** which acts as a rescue button in case a user may want to restart the game without finishing a level. Another important feature that has been implemented are two modal views. The first modal view, "**the modal game assistant**", introduces the user to the game in the beginning and pops up after the end of each level to display the game stats and to **lead the user to the next level**. The second modal view, "**the game preview**", is where the cards are presented to the user in the same order as they are going to be played. The user gets enough time to memorise the cards, their position and colors and can choose when to start the game. At the end of the game, although not important for the game play itself, the user will be invited to click a link to read more about what this game is all about or to play all over again.



#### Features Left to Implement

The design of the current cards has **letters as motives** only and it would be interesting to test if the level of difficulty to memorise will increase or decrease depending on motives such as **numbers**, **geometrical shapes** or other **special characters**. As this is a game, the level of entertainment would improve by adding more animations at the right places.



## Design



### Programming Approach

```
# General approach

card creation (playing cards)
  `-> use cards to create game layout
            `-> each card has a click function
                                  `-> clicked cards gets 
                                      - registered
                                      - rendered
                                      - evaluated


# Functions implemented

loadGame()
    `-> createGameLayout()
            `-> selectedCard()
                    `-> evaluateCards()
                                        
```





### UX



#### Design Choices

The navigation throughout the game is designed to be intuitive. To keep the design simple, the base colors are neutral and low profile while the playing cards are designed to spark entertainment and keep the eye busy and therefor focused on the cards. 



#### Wireframes and Layout

The game layout is divided into three sections, a header, the main gaming area with a deck of cards and a footer section which is reserved for additional game related buttons such as settings or other information that might be important to the game. 

![ms2-wireframe-1](/assets/images/ms2-wireframe-1.png)

The first level starts with 8 hidden cards and the user has to flip each card to find letter pairs. Once all cards have been discovered, the user can move on to the next level. Each additional level will add another row of cards. This game offers 4 levels and can display up to 20 cards in this layout with the given card size.  

![ms2-layout-1](/assets/images/ms2-layout-1.png)

Each card has a default size of 100 * 100px but its implementation is responsive. In CSS the card width is `calc(94% / 4)` so that it looks the same on each device ranging from 320px up to any desktop width where the total width of the game area is limited. To create the contrast between the background and the playing cards, I chose to use earthy and calm colors for the background, while the playing cards are a combination of monochromatic color schemes of pink and purple.

## Technologies Used



This project is written in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. All of the custom code is written with the **Visual Studio Code** editor on a personal **Mac** computer. This project uses **Git** for version control and is stored as a public repository at **GitHub**. The gaming cards as well as the images you see in this Readme file are produced in **Sketch**.



### Testing



#### HTML

The **HTML** code has been validated by direct input in the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and resulted in the following warning:

Warning 1: **The** `type` **attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources.**
To fix this issue I have simply deleted the `type` attribute: 
From: `<script src="assets/js/app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`
To: `<script src="assets/js/app.js"></script>`



Warning 2: **Empty heading.**
To fix this issue I have changed the `h3` tag: 
From: `<h3><span id="game-assistant"></span></h3>`
To: `<p><span id="game-assistant"></span></p>`

The two issues have been resolved and the respond was positive: **Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.**



#### CSS

The **CSS** code has been validated by direct input in the [W3C Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and the respond of the validator has been positive:
W3C CSS Validator results for TextArea (CSS level 3 + SVG): **Congratulations! No Error Found.**



#### JavaScript

To debug JavaScript the Chrome browser has been used extensively. `console.log()` and `console.table()` were my favorite tools to see if outputs were logged as expected. Here are the bugs I encountered:

Console warning 1:

```bash
# Bug alert:
app.js:34 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of null
    at createCards (app.js:34)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (app.js:42)

# Bug issue:
const board = document.querySelector("board");  # missing the dot in front of "board" 

# Bug fixed:
const board = document.querySelector(".board"); # fixed with ".board"

```

Console warning 2:

```bash
# Bug alert:
app.js:111 Uncaught TypeError: this.getAttribute is not a function
    at selectedCard (app.js:111)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (app.js:120)

# Bug issue:
app.js:111: var cardId = this.getAttribute('data-id'); # this was raised as an issue
app.js:120: selectedCard(); # this was the problem as the function was was not finished, but I have already logged the function with console.log

# Bug fixed:
# commenting my console.log fixed the bug!

```



#### Game play issues

To create a smooth game play experience I had to iron out some unexpected behaviour that are not really coding bugs but game play bugs:

-   **Issue 1:** Each click of a card will register the id in the `cardsFlippedId` array. When clicking fast enough through multiple cards the user can select more than 2 cards which is undesired as only 2 cards are required to check if they match.
    -   **Solution:** To solve this issue the last item will be removed using the `.pop()` method when the array exceeds 2 items. 
-   **Issue 2:** Clicking multiple times on the same card was an issue as well and resulted in undesired results in the game play.
    -   **Solution:** To solve this issue I removed the event listener on already selected cards.





#### Testing Performance with Lighthouse

**Google Chrome's Developer Tools** are used extensively for debugging as well as the built-in **Lighthouse** project to test the performance of this application. The responsive design has been tested using **Google Chrome's responsive feature** that emulates screen sizes of various mobile devices. Further testing has been conducted through available devices such as MacBook Pro 13", iPad 12" and iPhone 8. 

The Lighthouse generated report for **Desktop** gave these result in the following categories:

-   Performance: 100
-   Accessibility: 100
-   Best Practices: 100
-   SEO: 89 - Explanation: Document does not have a meta description

The Lighthouse generated report for **Mobile** gave these result in the following categories:

-   Performance: 99
-   Accessibility: 100
-   Best Practices: 100
-   SEO: 91 - Explanation: Document does not have a meta description





## Deployment

The repository of this project is stored at **GitHub** and the site is deployed as **GitHub page**.
